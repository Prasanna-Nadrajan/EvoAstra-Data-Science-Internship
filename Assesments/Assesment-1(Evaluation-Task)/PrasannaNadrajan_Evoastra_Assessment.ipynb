For the Young segment, consider strategies to reduce their high return rate (e.g., improved product descriptions, better sizing guides, virtual try-on features) and increase average purchase value. For the Senior segment, focus on improving customer satisfaction to reduce their high churn rate (e.g., simplified user interfaces, dedicated customer support, personalized assistance). Re-evaluate acquisition channels for these segments to ensure positive ROI."

        "# - Customer Age: Numerical feature, likely to influence purchase behavior and churn.\n",
        "# - Gender: Categorical feature, potential differences in churn rates between genders.\n",
        "# - Product Category: Categorical feature, certain categories might be associated with higher or lower churn.\n",
        "# - Product Price: Numerical feature, price sensitivity can impact churn.\n",
        "# - Quantity: Numerical feature, frequency/volume of purchases could be a churn indicator.\n",
        "# - Total Purchase Amount: Numerical feature, overall spending patterns are crucial.\n",
        "# - Payment Method: Categorical feature, preference for certain payment methods might correlate with loyalty.\n",
        "# - Returns: Binary/Categorical feature, a strong indicator of dissatisfaction and potential churn.\n",
        "# 'Customer ID', 'Customer Name', 'Purchase Date' would likely not be used directly as features; 'Purchase Date' could be engineered into features like 'days since last purchase' or 'purchase frequency'.\n",

        "# b) Data Preprocessing Steps:\n",
        "# 1. Handle Missing Values: Depending on the extent, missing values could be imputed (e.g., mean/median for numerical, mode for categorical) or rows/columns with excessive missingness could be dropped.\n",
        "# 2. Encode Categorical Variables: 'Gender', 'Product Category', 'Payment Method' would need to be converted into numerical format. One-hot encoding is suitable for nominal categorical variables.\n",
        "# 3. Scale Numerical Features: 'Customer Age', 'Product Price', 'Quantity', 'Total Purchase Amount' often benefit from scaling (e.g., StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the model.\n",
        "# 4. Feature Engineering (Optional but Recommended): Create new features from 'Purchase Date' (e.g., 'days since last purchase', 'purchase frequency') to capture temporal patterns.\n",
        "# 5. Handle Imbalanced Data: Churn datasets are typically imbalanced (fewer churned customers than retained). Techniques like oversampling (SMOTE), undersampling, or using algorithms robust to imbalance should be considered during model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "# c) Model Evaluation Metrics:\n",
        "# For an imbalanced churn prediction problem, accuracy alone is not sufficient. We would use a combination of the following metrics:\n",
        "# 1. Precision: The proportion of predicted churners who actually churned (minimizing false positives).\n",
        "# 2. Recall (Sensitivity): The proportion of actual churners that were correctly identified (minimizing false negatives, crucial for retention efforts).\n",
        "# 3. F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.\n",
        "# 4. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC): Measures the model's ability to distinguish between churned and retained customers across various threshold settings.\n",
        "# 5. Confusion Matrix: To visualize the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing a clear breakdown of classification performance.\n",
